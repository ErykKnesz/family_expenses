# family_expenses
kodilla mod.9 zad 2

The purpose of this app is to organise family expenses to optimise spending and drive frugal lifestyle. If you want to do just that feel free to clone the repository. Bear in mind that you will need Python v3.9 with modules as stated in requirements.txt. 

The project consists of a table that shows what has been bought, in what quantity and for how much. To implement changes, use the form below the table. All data is saved in a json file and it is advisable to establish a timeframe, e.g. a month and track spending regularly. Personally, I clear out the table at the start of each month and begin to accumulate expenses for the new month. 

For the time being, the app lacks the feature of summing up of the expenses, this, however, is planned to change so the user will not have to do that on their own in the future, as this is obviously the point of it all.
